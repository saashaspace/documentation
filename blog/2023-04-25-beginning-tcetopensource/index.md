# TIME FOR A FLASHBACK!
TCET- Open Source isn't just a random thought at a random time on a random day; the brainstorming, the filtration, and the selection, all of it was a task and eventually, it resulted into something like this!

## The First Failure
The events that used to take place in our college covered almost everything related to different techstacks and the futuristic technologies; from Competitive Programming (CP) to Blockchain, simply just everything. The only topic left out to be discussed upon in detail remained to be open source. For the very first time, we tried to make this thought come to life via hosting an event on the same. Unfortunately, it had to get cancelled. But as they say, 'All that happens is for some greater good', and so we never lost hope in that idea.

## New Beginnings
The GFG-Chapter of our college does have some brilliant minds who are very inclined and passionate about technology and so the group came up with this idea of forming a whole new organisation. When we decided to approach a senior and shared him the idea, he casually just said "Haan, mene hi banaya hai wo!" ("Yes, I'm the one who made that!") and that's how it begun.

## Planning and Future Projects 
Currently, we are building our college website and the student-teacher login interface from scratch. Having all the information precisely at one place is really important for a college-going student because a great number of opportunities exist. And also, to make it easier for the teachers to let every student know without any fail, we came with this project. 
Well, this is just a start and we've far far far more to do!
Open Source Team let's gooooooo!
